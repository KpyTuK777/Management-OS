# Architecture Backlog

This file contains exactly one active architectural task.

## Current Phase

```text
Phase III-B — Operational Core / M6 Product Realization
```

## Current Milestone

```text
M6 — Canonical Operational Design System
```

## Current Task

```text
Architecture Review — M6 Canonical Design Semantics
```

## Dependencies

- Canonical Management Model — Confirmed.
- M6 Canonical Operational Design System Charter — Architecture Definition
  complete.
- M6 Canonical Design Object Model — Architecture Definition complete.
- M6 Canonical Design Semantics — Architecture Definition prepared for review.

## Expected Output

An evidence-based Architecture Review disposition recorded in the repository:

```text
Approved for M6 dependency use
```

or:

```text
Approved with Required Corrections
```

The disposition must establish whether Canonical Design Semantics can serve as
the semantic dependency for the Canonical Rendering Model.

## Owner

```text
Chief Architect
```

The Lead Engineer prepares the review evidence and applies only corrections
explicitly returned by the review.

## Status

```text
Ready for Architecture Review
```

## Definition of Done

- The document is reviewed against the M6 Charter and Canonical Design Object
  Model.
- Semantic roles, composition rules, invariants, mappings, adapter independence,
  and conformance criteria are complete and mutually consistent.
- No role creates or reassigns domain truth, information residency, navigation,
  interaction, authority, lifecycle, or visual meaning.
- Dependencies on Visual Semantics, Operational Interaction Language, and
  Information Architecture preserve their canonical ownership.
- The Architecture Review verdict and evidence are recorded in the repository.
- All required corrections are absent or resolved.
- `ROADMAP.md` is advanced to the approved next stage.
- This file is replaced with exactly one task for that stage.
